Subject: res_geolocation

* Added processing for the 'confidence' element.
* Added documentation to some APIs.
* removed a lot of complex code related to the very-off-nominal
  case of needing to process multiple location info sources.
* Create a new 'ast_geoloc_eprofile_to_pidf' API that just takes
  one eprofile instead of a datastore of multiples.
* Plugged a huge leak in XML processing that arose from
  insufficient documentation by the libxml/libxslt authors.
* Refactored stylesheets to be more efficient.
* Renamed 'profile_action' to 'profile_precedence' to better
  reflect it's purpose.
* Added the config option for 'allow_routing_use' which
  sets the value of the 'Geolocation-Routing' header.
* Removed the GeolocProfileCreate and GeolocProfileDelete
  dialplan apps.
* Changed the GEOLOC_PROFILE dialplan function as follows:
  * Removed the 'profile' argument.
  * Automatically create a profile if it doesn't exist.
  * Delete a profile if 'inheritable' is set to no.
* Fixed various bugs and leaks
* Updated Asterisk WiKi documentation.

Added 4 built-in profiles:
  "<prefer_config>"
  "<discard_config>"
  "<prefer_incoming>"
  "<discard_incoming>"
The profiles are empty except for having their precedence
set.

Added profile parameter "suppress_empty_ca_elements" that
will cause Civic Address elements that are empty to be
suppressed from the outgoing PIDF-LO document.

You can now specify the location object's format, location_info,
method, location_source and confidence parameters directly on
a profile object for simple scenarios where the location
information isn't common with any other profiles.  This is
mutually exclusive with setting location_reference on the
profile.

Added an 'a' option to the GEOLOC_PROFILE function to allow
variable lists like location_info_refinement to be appended
to instead of replacing the entire list.

Added an 'r' option to the GEOLOC_PROFILE function to resolve all
variables before a read operation and after a Set operation.
