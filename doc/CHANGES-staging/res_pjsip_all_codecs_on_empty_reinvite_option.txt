Subject: res_pjsip

A new option named "all_codecs_on_empty_reinvite" has been added to the
global section. When this option is enabled, on reception of a re-INVITE
without SDP, Asterisk will send an SDP offer in the 200 OK response containing
all configured codecs on the endpoint, instead of simply those that have
already been negotiated. RFC 3261 specifies this as a SHOULD requirement.
The default value is "off".
